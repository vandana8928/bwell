                    <h2>What are the mental health benefits of exercise?</h2>
                    <h3>
                        Exercise is a powerful depression fighter for several reasons. Most importantly, it promotes all kinds of changes in the brain, including neural growth, reduced inflammation, and new activity patterns that promote feelings of calm and well-being.
                        <br><br>Studies show that exercise can treat mild to moderate depression as effectively as antidepressant medication—but without the side-effects, of course.
                        <br><br>Exercise serve as a distraction, allowing you to find some quiet time to break out of the cycle of negative thoughts that feed depression.
                        <br>
                        <br>People who exercise regularly tend to do so because it gives them an enormous sense of well-being. They feel more energetic throughout the day, sleep better at night, have sharper memories, and feel more relaxed and positive
                        about themselves and their lives. And it’s also a powerful medicine for many common mental health challenges.

                        <br>
                        <br>Make exercise a fun part of your everyday life.<br>You don’t have to spend hours in a gym or force yourself into long, monotonous workouts to experience the many benefits of exercise. These tips can help you find activities
                        you enjoy and start to feel better, look better, and get more out of life.</h3>

        Perhaps the simplest way to get some stress-busting exercise is to go for a brisk walk.
         The Anxiety and Depression Association of America reports that some studies suggest
          that a 10-minute walk can be enough to restore calm and may be just as helpful as a
           45-minute or longer walk when it comes to reducing stress and anxiety. </h6>
